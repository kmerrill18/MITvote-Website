              <h2>Voting Safely During the Pandemic</h2>
                <p>It's important think about how you will minimize your risk of infection while you cast your vote. Many states have expanded vote-by-mail in response. Voting by mail allows you to cast your vote without actually going to the polls. Another way to minimize risk of infection is vote early, since polls are usually less crowded on ealry voting days. You can also vote in-person on election day with proper precautions. For more information on voting safely during the pandemic, check out <a href="N95DECON_SaferVoting_Graphic_final.pdf">this infographic</a> from <a href="https://www.n95decon.org/">N95DECON</a> on voting safely this fall. If you have any questions about voting in your state or changes to the normal process due to the pandemic, fill out <a href="http://vote.mit.edu/questions">THIS FORM</a> and an MITvote team member will get back to you shortly!</p>

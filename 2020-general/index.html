The MA secretary of state office strongly recommends you request your mail in ballot as soon as possible. You can find a downloadable mail-in ballot application <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/2020-Vote-by-Mail-Application.pdf">HERE.</a> If you are registered to vote in Cambridge, mail your completed application to the Cambridge Election Commision at the following address:<br>

              <h2>MITvote is a nonpartisan group of graduates and undergraduates with the goal of engaging an active voter community on campus. Our mission is to make voting as accessible as possible to everyone and encourage civic participation on MIT's campus.</h2>
                <p>We organize voter registration drives, hold absentee ballots events, provide information on how to vote to students, and connect students with voter resources. We work to raise awareness of upcoming elections and educate students on how to participate in the civic process. We participate in activism surrounding voter issues and support legislation like same-day voter registration, expanding early voting, and non-citizen voting in municipal elections.</p>

              <h2>Reflections on 2018</h2>
                  <p>After the 2018 election season, MITvote wrote a report detailing our actions leading up the election and our success. We found <strong>196% increase</strong> in voter turnout on campus in the 2018 midterm elections over the 2014 midterm elections. If you would like to learn more about what MITvote has done in the past, what worked, what didn't and how voter registration and turnout changed in 2018, check out that report <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19tNFgs75q9pwYHZnvZpXlsqEInxK8CIG/view?usp=sharing/> HERE!</a><p>
                  <p>Email <a href='mailto:vote-exec@mit.edu'>vote-exec@mit.edu</a> if you have any questions!</p>
              <h2>Join Us!</h2>
                  <p>MITvote needs people in all levels of commitment and involvement. We would love to have more regular attendees to help us plan and run events, poster, create voter materials, and help with administrative tasks. We are also currently recruiting students to act as liaisons to their communities. This role would include encouraing and reminding your peers to register and vote, as well as providing and the necessary forms and answering any questions they have. Lastly, we also need a healthy list of volunteers for staffing registration drives and events, which is more of a sign up as you can basis.</p>
                  <p>If you are interested in helping out, please email us at <a href="mailto:vote-exec@mit.edu">vote-exec@mit.edu</a>, and we can tell you more about us. Being a regular member of MITvote generally requires about 1-2 hours a week of commitment. If you are interested in volunteering but you don't want the regular time commitment, please add yourself to our mailing list (mitvote-all@mit.edu) to receive emails with club info and volunteer opportunities. Thank you so much for your interest!</p>

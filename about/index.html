              <h4>MITvote is a nonpartisan group of graduates and undergraduates with the goal of engaging an active voter community on campus. Our mission is to make voting as accessible as possible for everyone and encourage civic participation on MIT's campus.</h4>
                <p>We organize voter registration drives, hold absentee ballots events, provide information on how to vote to students, and connect students with voter resources. We work to raise awareness of upcoming elections and educate students on how to participate in the civic process. We also participate in activism surrounding voter issues and support legislation like same-day voter registration, expanding early voting, and expaning mail-in voting.</p>

              <h2>Current Projects</h2>
                <p>MITvote will primarily be focused on city elections in Cambridge and Boston this year. We are currently planning for the 2021 Election season. As in previous years, we are planning to table in Lobby 10, table at the MIT flu shot clinic, hold vote-by-mail events, hold a local elections panel, and hold an Election Day event.</p>
                <h4>ALL IN Challenge</h4>
                <p>In Fall of 2020, MIT joined the nationwide <a href="https://allinchallenge.org/" target="_blank">ALL IN Challenge</a>. We are currently working with faculty and staff from around the institute to make voter turnout efforts a solidified and automatic part of life at MIT.</p>
                <h4>Guest Blogging for the PKG Center</h4>
                <p>Since the spring, MITvote has been guest blogging for the PKG Center. You can find all of our posts on the PKG Center blog <a href="https://pkgcenter.mit.edu/blog/" target="_blank">HERE!</a></p>
                <h4>BostonVotes - collaboration with other Boston-area schools</h4>
                <p>Last fall, MITvote joined a coalition of groups like us at other Boston-area schools. This coalition allows us to share ideas and resources between groups to advance the larger goal of student voter turnout. We work with them to advance common goals and demands for institutional support and voter turnout goals.</p>
              <h2>Reflections on Past Election Seasons</h2>
                <p>Each year, MITvote authors a report detailing our activities leading up to the election and our success. Though turnout data is not yet available for 2020, data shows we reached more students and engaged with more of the MIT community than ever before in 2020. In the report, we discuss what we did differently this year, what worked well, what was less successful, and lessons we will carry forward for the future. Read the entire report <a href=2020_success_report.pdf target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
                <p>You can find our past reports below.</p>

              <h2>Join Us!</h2>
                  <p>MITvote needs people in all levels of commitment and involvement. We would love to have more regular attendees to help us plan and run events, run social media, poster, create voter materials, and brainstorm new ways to reach students. We also need a healthy list of volunteers for staffing registration drives and events, which is more of a sign up as you can basis.</p>
                  <p>If you are interested in helping out, please email us at <a href="mailto:vote-exec@mit.edu">vote-exec@mit.edu</a>, and we can tell you more about us! We can also add you to our Slack, which requires no commitment, but allows you to get MITvote announcements and stay in touch with the group.</p>

              <h2>Primary Election Format Vocabulary</h2>
              <p>Each state and sometimes each party within a given state has its own date and format for the primary elections.</p>
                  <h4>Caucus</h4>
                  <p>A caucus takes the place of a traditional primary election in some states. In a caucus, the members of a political party meet in a convention and register their support for a given candidate. For more information on the difference between a caucus and a primary election, click <a href=https://www.businessinsider.com/primaries-caucuses-differences-between-which-states-2019-3/>here</a>.</p>
                  <h4>Open/Closed</h4>
                  <p>The distinction Open/Semiopen/Semiclosed/Closed determines which people of which party affiliations can vote in which primary. In an open primary, anyone can vote in the primary of their choosing, even if they are registered in a different party. In a semi-open primary, anyone may vote in the primary of their choosing, but they must publically declare the party primary they are choosing to vote in. Voting in that primary may be taken as registration in that party. In a semi-closed party, unaffiliated voters may vote in the primary of their choosing, but people registered with a specific primary must vote in that primary. In a closed primary, only those registered with the party may vote in that party's primary. For more information, click <a href=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx/>here</a>.</p>
                  <h4>Partisan/Nonpartisan Voter Registration</h4>
                  <p>In a partisan voter registration system, a person's party registration is recorded with their voter registration. The party a person chooses to register with may determine which primary they can vote in (see Open/Closed above). In a nonpartisan voter registration system, a person's political party is not recorded with their registration.</p>
              <h2>Massachusetts Primary</h2>
                <p>The Massachusetts Primary was held on Tuesday, March 3rd (Super Tuesday). The Massachusetts primary is semi-closed, meaning that if you are registered with a party, you must vote in that party, but if you are not registered with a specific party, you may choose which party primary to vote in.</p>

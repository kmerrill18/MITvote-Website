            <p>Unsure about whether to vote in the 2022 election? Our panelists argue voting this year is important for democracy itself!</p>
            <p>With election denialism on the rise and many state and local offices on the ballot, it is important that we vote in people willing to protect our democratic institutions. Watch the full panel <a href="https://web.mit.edu/webcast/mitvote/f22/">HERE</a> for discussion of the importance of the 2022 elections in the current moment, election security, polarization, and more!</p>

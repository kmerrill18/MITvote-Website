            <p>Unsure about whether to vote in the 2020 election, or if your vote really matters? (Spoiler: it does!).</p>
            <p>Listen to our panel "The Impact of Your Vote: How your vote up and down the ballot affects the issues you care about" to learn from panelists about how your vote in races beyond the presidency has an impact on issues like climate change, racial justice and more!</p>
            <p>We heard from: 
              <ul>
                <li>Bina Venkataramaan who teaches in STS at MIT and is the editor of Boston Globe's editorial page as well as a former climate policy expert in the Obama White House.</li>
                <li>Jared Evans, policy counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund</li>
                <li>MIT's own Charles Stewart, professor in Course 17, director of the CalTech/MIT Voting Technology Project and co-founder of the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project</li>
              </ul>
              The panel was moderated by David Goldston, director of the MIT Washington Office.
            </p>
            <p>You can find small, targeted clips of the panel on the MITvote YouTube channel found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF9VMjdB3Rwaar14oZoRkEA/">HERE</a>.</p>
